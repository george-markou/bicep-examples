# A repository full of practical examples of Bicep Languange

## Welcome
Hi there! It's been a while since I've started my journey with BicepLang and I wanted to share with all of you the templates that I've been authoring. For that reason, I've created this public Github repo that contains reusable templates. I haven't yet moved or refactored all of them yet, but we are getting there, soon :) Enjoy!
